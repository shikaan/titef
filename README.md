# Titef
Tiny, zero-dependecies test framework for newbies.

It runs on top of NodeJS and it's meant to unit-test JavaScript 
applications.

## Why you should use it?
1. It has everything you need in most of the cases in only ~3.5Kb;
2. It has an almost flat learning curve if you're already familiar with 
other testing frameworks like Mocha, Jasmine, Jest;
3. It has an almost flat learning curve even though you're not familiar 
with other testing technologies but you're familiar with ES6+ 
(opinionated);
4. It's deadly simple. You can read the source and understand how it 
works in less than one hour;

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev titef
```

## Getting started

Usually [documentation](https://shikaan.github.io/titef) is the best
place to start. If you're really looking forward to testing right now,
you may want to take a look at

running in no time.
