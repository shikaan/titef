# Contributing

What rules you need to follow to contribute to this project in order to
make everyone happy.

Before you start making your hand dirty, it better if you take a look at
[developer documentation](../lib/README.md) and
[API documentation](https://shikaan.github.io/titef/api/)

### Code of conduct
Before writing any line in this repo, please read the
[Code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) otherwise, if you really are
too busy to do it, simply don't be a jerk.

### First issues
Actually every issue is pretty much good as first issue, since the
code still looks very easy and clean. You can take a look at
[issues](https://github.com/shikaan/titef/issues) or at
[projects](https://github.com/shikaan/titef/projects) if you don't
know where to start.

### Pull Request
Every Pull Request should be made filling the precompiled form, which
is supposed to guide the contributor to explain clearly what has been
done,cwhy it has been done and what's left. Suggestions to edit the
[Pull Request Template](./PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) are always welcome.

Along with this evey pull request should be linted and tested.

Testing can de dodgy: how can you test something which is supposed to
test? So I didn't put any real bottleneck: every Pull Request will be
evaluated on its own.

### Bug Report
Golden rule: do not only explain what you were doing, but also explain
how you were doing it. Any screen shot, link, gif, log or whatever is
greatly appreciated!

Also, check if any bug has already been reported and give it a `+1`:
this way we'll understand what we need to focus on. Bugs with higher
scores will be addressed earlier.

### Feature request
There's a lot to be done! If you come up with any idea please let us
know, but please - again - check if such feature has already been
requested. If that's the case, give it a `+1`: feature with higher
score will be addressed earlier.
